Git and Github work really well with tracking how a project changes. I have access to all versions of my project that I commit, which means I can go back and review anything if needed.

I bought the domain 'megpet.click'

Caddy: handles incoming HTTP requests. Either serves static files or routes to another web service (called  gateway or reverse proxy). Helps support HTTPS.

HTTPS uses encryption via the TLS protocol.(aka SSl)

Web certificates generated by 3rd party, is requried for owning a domain

Always support HTTPS in the applications you build.

HTML: HyperText Markup Language
Provides content structure.

Web page evolution to web application. 

HTML elements have tags. example: <p> and </p> are the opening and closing tags of the paragraph element

<html> top level page structure, <head> is metadata and the page title, <main> is main content besides headers, footers, nav, asides, etc.

Attributes like id (# in CSS) and class (. in CSS) 

Hyperlinks: <a href="linkName">Link Name</a> a means anchor

<--Comment structure -->

Some characters require using an alternate entity. Example: to display '<' you would say '&lt;'

index.html is commonly the main page for an application

Block vs inline: block means distinct, and inline does not distrupt the flow. <div> is a block element that could contain inline element <b>. Similarly, <p> can contain <span>.

HTML input elements include form, input, option, label, etc.

The form element submits values of the input it contains. The input lement is set with a type such as number, checkbox, text, color, submit button, etc.

HTML Media: img, video, audio, svg (Scalable Vector graphics), canvas, etc.

External media takes urls.

<img src="" alt="">
<audio controls src=""></audio>
<video controls width="" crossorigin="anonymous"> <source src="" /> </video>

Internal media svg and canvas create images using HTML

CSS:
responsive and stylistic. Uses rulesets that are comprised of selectors and declarations. Declarations represent properties that style with property values.

How to use CSS:
1. Use <style> element to apply directly in HTML file. Use in the <head> elementif you want it to apply to the whole document, or put it directly in a specific element. Ex: <p style="color:green">CSS</p> for just the paragraph.

Link external CSS stylesheet (preferred)

Rules cascade from highest nodes (general) to lowest (specific). The lower/more specific declaration with override the others.

Box model: innermost box has content, then padding, then border, then margin (whitespace).

CSS Selectors: 
Select elements from HTML

* is the wildcard selector for all elements

Combinators include descendant, child, general sibling, and adjacent sibling.

class selectors use periods. .class. can also combine - p.class

ID selectors use #. #id.

Attribute selector use [].

Pseudo selectors are conditional, like :hover.

CSS Declarations:

Specify what it is you want to style.

Common units: px, pt, in, cm, %, vmin

Color can be used by the word, the RGB hex/function, or the HSL

@font-face imports fonts.

To animate, declare an animation-name and animation-duration. Then create keyframes, 'from' and 'to', with percentages in between. Use @keyframes demo{} 

Responsive design:
responds to screen size.

Block: width that fills parent element (p and div)
Inline: width only as big as its content (b or span)
Flex: element's children in a flexible orientation
Grid: element's children in a grid orientation
none: won't render on browser

viewport meta tag tells browser not to scale the page

Float property can move an element respective to its container. Helps with wrapping.

@media queries dynamically detects size and orientation of browser.
