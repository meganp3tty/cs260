Git and Github work really well with tracking how a project changes. I have access to all versions of my project that I commit, which means I can go back and review anything if needed.

I bought the domain 'megpet.click'

Caddy: handles incoming HTTP requests. Either serves static files or routes to another web service (called  gateway or reverse proxy). Helps support HTTPS.

HTTPS uses encryption via the TLS protocol.(aka SSl)

Web certificates generated by 3rd party, is requried for owning a domain

Always support HTTPS in the applications you build.

HTML: HyperText Markup Language
Provides content structure.

Web page evolution to web application. 

HTML elements have tags. example: <p> and </p> are the opening and closing tags of the paragraph element

<html> top level page structure, <head> is metadata and the page title, <main> is main content besides headers, footers, nav, asides, etc.

Attributes like id (# in CSS) and class (. in CSS) 

Hyperlinks: <a href="linkName">Link Name</a> a means anchor

<--Comment structure -->

Some characters require using an alternate entity. Example: to display '<' you would say '&lt;'

index.html is commonly the main page for an application

Block vs inline: block means distinct, and inline does not distrupt the flow. <div> is a block element that could contain inline element <b>. Similarly, <p> can contain <span>.

HTML input elements include form, input, option, label, etc.

The form element submits values of the input it contains. The input lement is set with a type such as number, checkbox, text, color, submit button, etc.

HTML Media: img, video, audio, svg (Scalable Vector graphics), canvas, etc.

External media takes urls.

<img src="" alt="">
<audio controls src=""></audio>
<video controls width="" crossorigin="anonymous"> <source src="" /> </video>

Internal media svg and canvas create images using HTML
