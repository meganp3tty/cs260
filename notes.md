Git and Github work really well with tracking how a project changes. I have access to all versions of my project that I commit, which means I can go back and review anything if needed.

I bought the domain 'megpet.click'

Caddy: handles incoming HTTP requests. Either serves static files or routes to another web service (called  gateway or reverse proxy). Helps support HTTPS.

HTTPS uses encryption via the TLS protocol.(aka SSl)

Web certificates generated by 3rd party, is requried for owning a domain

Always support HTTPS in the applications you build.
